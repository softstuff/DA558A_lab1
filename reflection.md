It was hard to keep the global data like headers and footers in sync while working in plain html and not to
have a front end tools like React to keep data isolated.

Pixel perfect is a myth, it will never happen. It is really hard to be happy with "good enough" when css can be done in a million ways.

I like the isolation effect of CSS Module and yes I only used the concept and not the real stuff with a preprocessor taking care of the css isolation.

I used AI to generate all the test data, It is kind of new to me but I really like that work flow.

I hope I did not blow the contact form by doing it with javascript form a empty form tag. Noted that the popup blocker needed to be change for it to work.
